# Fine-Tuned BART Model for Text Summarization

## Overview
This repository contains the script `finetuned_bart.py`, designed for fine-tuning, evaluating, and using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model for text summarization. BART, developed by Facebook AI, excels in natural language understanding and generation tasks.

## Features
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt the BART model to specific characteristics of a custom dataset for improved summarization.
- **Summarization**: Demonstrate the use of the fine-tuned model to generate summaries for new texts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- PyTorch
- Transformers Library (Hugging Face)
- NLTK

## Usage
1. **Fine-Tuning the Model**:
   - Fine-tune the BART model on your dataset by running the script. Ensure your dataset is compatible with the script's data processing functions.
   - Adjust hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and epochs as needed.

2. **Generating Summaries**:
   - Generate summaries for new text inputs using the fine-tuned model.
   - The `generate_summary` function in the script takes a text input and outputs its summary.

## Customization
Modify the script to meet specific requirements, such as changing the dataset, adjusting preprocessing steps, tweaking model parameters, or using different evaluation metrics.
